# Covid-19 Symptom Detector


This system consists of a temperature sensor to detect fever, a facial detection system to identify if the user is wearing a mask or not, and a verbal symptom confirmation tool to ensure the user does not experience more specific symptoms. If all three tests are passed, the user is admitted into the public space- otherwise, they are turned away and asked to leave.
